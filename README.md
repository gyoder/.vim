# My Super Cool and Awesome (Neo)Vim Config

This config should work with Vim* and Neovim. It won't work great with vim, it 
will throw a bunch of errors, but it is pretty good with Neovim. It is also 
configured to work with Purdue's CS server and workstation. It will not 
load all plugins and will use the Eastwood linter.

## One Line Install

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gyoder/.vim/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you are a Purdue student installing this on data, use this line to get neovim and clangd

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gyoder/.vim/master/data_install.sh | bash
```
